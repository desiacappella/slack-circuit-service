# slack-circuit-service

A Slack bot that will provide automation services for circuit members.

- Invite people who submit form entries to the Slack request form after a quick look-over by an ASA board member
- Allow Slack guests to join any "open" #circuit- channels that may exist
- Organize and allow ASA board members to quickly see who is part of which team. Eventually tying this to Ekta membership would be godlike
- Potentially automatically create a "team channel" if any of the captains would like that
- Automatically move captains who have graduated into the #circuit-alumni channel and out of the #circuit-officers channel
